1) make sure that pest_processing.r creates desired summary of output vals from data
2) make sure that pest_ins_create.r creates instruction file that matches output variable names as shown in the output.txt file
3) run inschek tem.ins to make sure instructions are well formed.
4) make observations file by copying output.txt but replacing model values with observed (target) values
5) make output file from .ins and observations file in output.csv > .obf
6) create .par file with precision, decimal point on top line. then par name (from .tpl files), starting value, scale (1) and offset (0)
7) make basic control file > pestgen tem tem.par tem.obf
8) edit control file .pst - set number of template files - 2nd row of #, first column in control data section. Also change scale adjustment first number in parameter groups.
   -also change/transform parameters if necessary, set lower and upper bounds, and verify starting vals.
   -specify batch file in model command line
   -specify tpl files-space-path to corresponding config files
   - then .ins modeloutput.txt

trials
-read up on pest parameter weights- make inverse of value
-manually copy vals from colin calib into your file and run -done- didn't look good
-if it looks ok, use as starting point for pest run with parameter weights = use gsattempt confi file config files instead
-start with pest soil calib vals and run pest to optimize veg pools only for all pfts.
-copy in corrected (transformed) nc climate files.

ok- so trial with non-log transformed vals for pfts 3-6 based on gs attempt confi files

#optimization notes:

-assign parameters to different parameter groups
-assign observations to different observation groups

weight observations appropriately- weight smaller observations higher so they are visible
log-transform all parameters whose lower bound is greater than 0

log-transform observations as well?

set RLAMDA1 = 10.0
set RLAMFAC = -3

make SVD section- makes sure it maintains numerical stability.
SVDMODE = 1;
MAXSING = # of adjustable parameters;
EIGTHRESH = 5x10-7;
EIGWRITE = 0;

in control data section:
NOPTMAX = zero

- then run model once.
- then run PWTADJI - creates new pest control file.

add Tikhonov regularization to pest control file by running addreg1 utility

then later you can set PHIMLIM to value slightly higher than lowest achievable objective function

- so either the weighting will balance out the size of observations, or the log-transformation will. I am inclined to try the log-transformation first.
